Stuff that I need to revisit

* anywhere there's a TODO or MTWN_TODO_PRINTF()

* the whole mtwn_usb_cmd stuff - notably the cmd struct list management
  and cleanup.  Since we now have state and each state is on a specific
  list or no list at all, it should be easy to refactor things out to
  a 'newstate' routine that deletes from the old list and puts on the
  new list, and then the 'free' routine can just force move it to
  ALLOCED (ie ensure its on no list) before putting it on the inactive
  list.

* .. and then make sure the re-init path will do the right thing if
  buffers are already allocated/on lists...

* I FINALLY need to link the command write/wait/read response stuff
  together so I can continue with bring-up
